This tool will help you to create CLI utilities. You got a set of tools and you will able:

- Create CLI dialog and beautiful messages;
- Easy to resolve, read, write files;
- Work with JSON;
- Ejs templates;
- Create scaffolds and generators;
- Reuse modules.

# Getting started

```shell
npm install erector-cli -g
```
Enjoy.

# Creating modules

The easiest module of Erector is the plain file.

To write your first module, just create in any folder the file named `hello.js`. Open your favorite code editor and put to this file next code:
```js
import { echo, dialog } from 'erector';

default function* () {
  const name = yield dialog({
    message: 'Enter your name',
    type: 'string',
    required: true,
  });
  yield echo(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

Save it and then open your terminal in this directory and run next command:

```shell
erect hello.js
```

You will see the work of your script.

This is the simplest example of module of Erector.

## Using \__erector__ folder

There is a way to make your scripts more unobtrusive. Create in your project folder sub-directory with name `__erector__`.

```js
mkdir __erector__
```

Move your script `hello.js` from the root to the `__erector__` folder. And erect your script again, but without extension:

```shell
erect hello
```

This way it is more convenient to run scripts. You can use short names without extension and add `__erector__` to ignore lists, for example.

But wait, we can do something more. Create inside `__erector__` one more directory named `myscripts`. And then move your `hello.js` file into new folder.

You should have `__erector__/myscripts/hello.js`. Let try to run it.

```shell
erect myscripts/hello
```

Much better, right?

If you got a question - _Ð¡an I turn sub folder into the Npm package?_
Yes. You can. And you can use in your script any dependencies as you wish.

```shell
cd __erector__/myscripts
npm init
```

## Packages instead modules

If your script became big and strong, or it a whole set of scripts, you should turn it into a complete package.

Just create Npm package, name it with prefix `erector_...` and make it global by command `npm link`.

Now you can use your script in any place of your computer. So if your package is called `erector_doit`, your command will be.
```
erect doit
```

And if your script is pretty nice, you able to publish it in Npm. Then other people will be able to use it.

# Helpers

The helpers is a special functions which perform some frequent job. The Erector contains several dozen basic helpers. All of them are imported as follows:

```js
import { helperName } from 'erector';
```

Helpers will help you to write your scripts, removes the load from the hands. You should use them as often as possible.

And you do not need to install `erector` separately to make import from it. It always with you.

## List of basic helpers

Later you will learn how to write your own assistants, but the use of basic helpers simplifies life by covering common tasks.


### assignState
Assign state to the store. Equals to
setState with `Object.assign(state, {...})`
```js
yield assignState({
  name,
});
```
It can accept another helper as the first argument
```js
yield assignState(dialog([{
 name: {...}
}]));
```

| Param  | Type                | Description  | Default   |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| subject | `object|helper` | Data or helper | 


__Returns:__ `object` 



### calm
Intercepts errors inside `subject` and returns value of
onError as the normal result. If onError is a function
then it will handler of catch

| Param  | Type                | Description  | Default   |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| subject | `function|generator` |  | 
| onError | `any` |  | 




```js
const result = yield calm(
 writeFile('./someBlockedFile', ''),
 null
);
// result === null
```


### cancel
Cancel cancelable async task or channel.

```js
import { channel, cancel, echo } from 'erector';

export default function* () {
  const counter = yield channel(function* () {
    yield new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(
      () => resolve('tick'),
      1000,
    ));
  });
  let times = 0;
  while ( yield counter() ) {
    yield echo('tick');
    if (++times === 3 ) {
      yield cancel(counter);
    }
  }
  yield echo('done');
}
// tick
// tick
// tick
// done
```

| Param  | Type                | Description  | Default   |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| promise | `Promise|generator` | Channel or async task | 
| final | `any` | The value which will be returned after cancellation | 




### clear
Clear terminal




```js
yield clear();
```


### dialog
Starts CLI dialog (powered by inquirer).
If `questions` will be object, then an answer will be the only one (instead of array)

See [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for the ditails.

| Param  | Type                | Description  | Default   |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| questions | `array.<object>|object|helper` | Question(s) |

```js
const price = yield dialog({
 message: 'How much is the fish?',
 type: 'string',
});
yield echo(`The fish is ${price} coins`);
```


### echo
Print a message to the terminal (like console.log)

### ejs
In most typicall tasks, you do not need to specify `data` argument to parse you .ejs template.
In an overwhelming case for the compilation of the document is enough to give it a `template`.

```js
let filename = yield inModule('./templates/readme.jsx');

```js
yield writeFile('./readme.md', ejs(readFile(inModule('./templates/readme.jsx'))));
